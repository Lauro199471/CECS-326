The degrees of freedom, or DOF, is a very important term to understand. Each degree of freedom is a joint on the arm, a place where it can bend or rotate or translate. You can typically identify the number of degrees of freedom by the number of actuators on the robot arm. Now this is very important - when building a robot arm you want as few degrees of freedom allowed for your application!!! Why? Because each degree requires a motor, often an encoder, and exponentially complicated algorithms and cost. The Robot Arm Free Body Diagram (FBD) The Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) Convention is the accepted method of drawing robot arms in FBD's. There are only two motions a joint could make: translate and rotate. There are only three axes this could happen on: x, y, and z (out of plane). Below I will show a few robot arms, and then draw a FBD next to it, to demonstrate the DOF relationships and symbols. Note that I did not count the DOF on the gripper (otherwise known as the end effector). The gripper is often complex with multiple DOF, so for simplicity it is treated as separate in basic robot arm design. Notice between each DOF there is a linkage of some particular length. Sometimes a joint can have multiple DOF in the same location. An example would be the human shoulder. The shoulder actually has three coincident DOF. If you were to mathematically represent this, you would just say link length = 0. Also note that a DOF has its limitations, known as the configuration space. Not all joints can swivel 360 degrees! A joint has some max angle restriction. For example, no human joint can rotate more than about 200 degrees. Limitations could be from wire wrapping, actuator capabilities, servo max angle, etc. It is a good idea to label each link length and joint max angle on the FBD.
